It focuses on applying **CSS styling and responsive layout techniques** to a previously created semantic HTML structure.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to teach you how to **style a structured HTML website using CSS**.

You will learn:
- How to apply **CSS for layout**, spacing, and positioning
- How to use **flexbox**, **media queries**, and **responsive units**
- How to work with **typography, colors**, and **basic design patterns**
- How to make a website **responsive across devices**

## 🖼️ What to Build

Use your previously created HTML structure (from the Basic HTML Website project) and apply CSS styling to create:

- A **responsive layout**
- A **mobile-friendly navigation bar**
- Proper **spacing and typography**
- Clean, flexible sections (projects, contact form, etc.)

> 💡 You don't need to worry about perfect colors or fancy UI yet. Just make sure the layout works and looks clean across screen sizes.

## 📱 Responsiveness

Use **media queries** to handle layout changes for:
- Mobile devices (≤ 600px)
- Tablets (600px - 900px)
